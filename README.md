# FIFA20
Contains a filtered dataset to explore and study about FIFA20 players in the role of forward.
The full source data was in Kaggle and it was updated as per the beginning of 2020.
Then it's been filtered to keep only players in the role of forward (ST,LW,RW,CF...).
My idea was to study the dataset and the 29 features as a playing field for PCA in order to keep only few of them and find a way to name the new components.
